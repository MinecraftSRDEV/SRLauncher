Changes:

    Official translations for German, Spanish, French and Russian are now available! You can change the game language on the title screen as well as in-game via Options/Other/Language.
    A volcanic island is now explorable in the Indigo Quarry. It contains a host of crystal slimes and will be an important part of a future update.
    Teleporters have received a visual upgrade and now have fancy animations that our fancy artist added. They even have a fancy screen that tells you where it's going.
    Puddle slimes will now dramatically reduce their plort production when ~8 puddle plorts are nearby. This is because in addition to being very shy, puddle plorts also greatly dislike clutter. Strange slimes, those puddles.
    A few minor adjustments to the ranch house's lamps were added.
    Our code wizards have added a great many optimizations to rendering, especially when standing near large walls or when many objects are hidden from view. Additionally a great deal of optimizations were done to particle rendering, especially the crystal slime effects. This should all produce a substantial bump in performance for some players. Thanks, code wizards for using your magic for the good of humanity!

Fixes:

    Fixed bug where some hunter slimes could sometimes appear in an inactive state. We thought they were sleeping because cats tend to do that.
    Fixed bug where games progressed thousands of days in could become unstable. And hats off to the amazing player that discovered this naturally!
    Fixed bug where FOV would sometimes reset on game startup.
    Fixed bug where small items launched from the back would sometimes go through the floor/walls or get stuck in them.
    Fixed bug where carrots launched from the vacpack were sometimes more bouncy than intended. We've switched to a different produce supplier who grows less rubbery carrots.
