A bugfix patch was issued today to address a few smaller issues, as well as to begin address a larger, standing issue.

While this patch will not fix a save file that is currently unusable, it should mitigate future occurrences of the issue, so we decided to push this update now. We hope to have a solution for the unusable save files issues as soon as a fix is available. Thank you for your patience.
