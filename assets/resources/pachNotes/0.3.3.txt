Changes:

    The Pulse Wave has received an overhaul: the visuals have been greatly improved and the knockback and its effectiveness has been increased against largos and tarr.
    Boom slime explosion logic has been improved and has greatly reduced the chances of small items escaping corral barriers when they explode.
    An FOV slider has been added in the Video Options menu.
    Slimes that are actively fleeing Tarrs will now attempt to break up their slime stacks, because when things go south, it's every slime for themselves.
    Adjusted the volume and falloff of a number of sound effects.
    The music of the Slime Sea now has a new day and night theme.
    Adjusted a bunch of environmental props.
    Reordered a few items in the Slimepedia.
    Removed normal slime voice overs from ferals. It was hard to be intimidating when you sounded that darn cute.

Bugfixes:

    Fixed bug causing fruit and vegetables to shrivel too much when they rot.
    Fixed bug preventing use of “w” in text fields (game name, bug reports).
