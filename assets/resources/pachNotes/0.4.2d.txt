Another series of issues were discovered that we deemed worth a quick patch. This includes:

    Significantly reduce memory usage by game music (roughly 650 MB savings!). For those of you that just barely met the minimum requirements, you should see a significant performance boost.
    Fix rad poisoning text not updating
    Fix warp depot display text/bar not updating
    Fix flowers in Moss Blanket having turned yellow. Our best guess is that the winds were strong on our local build and blew some seeds over from the Ruins :)
