Another small patch was issued today to address additional issues related to the Slime Science Update:

    Fixed extractors sometimes resetting their timer on reloading a save file. Our best guess is they were cheating because they didn't want to explode :(
    Fixed spam of 'blueprint available' notifications on game reload.
    Fixed text of the "Builder's Shop" title.
    Fixed layout issue in certain languages and resolutions on About screen.
    Adjusted the Refinery's depositer area to more easily accept plorts. Let's all have a moment of silence for all those lost puddle plorts...
