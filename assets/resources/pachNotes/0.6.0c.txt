A small patch was issued today to address some additional issues related to the Glass Desert Update release:

    Changed some desert terrain slightly to improve player movement.
    Rotated one mosaic plort statue to be more accessible
    Added a few more decorative objects in desert to help make different areas a little more identifiable.
    Made firestorm effects and music remain active in more areas of the desert.
    Made firestorm effects timing more precise.
    Updated the Main Menu to use the new skybox.
    Improved chicken efficiency to improve performance. And because an efficient hen hen is a happy hen hen.
    Added two new places to build Slime Science gadgets within the desert.
    Fixed bug where some tangle slime statues would reset to being unfilled on game reload.
    Fixed bug where fruit on garden trees could sometimes appear too low on the tree.
    Fixed bug where garden patches could sometimes end up with no crop but not allow the next crop to be planted.
    Fixed bug where small items around the oasis plant would rest just under the visible ground.
    Fixed typo in one of Ogden's Range Exchange greetings.
