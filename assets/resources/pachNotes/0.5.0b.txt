A patch was issued today to fix some bugs following the release of v0.5.0:

    Fixed bug where quantum plort was not shown on the Refinery screen.
    Fixed bug where quantum slimes could escape the grotto to above the ceiling.
    Fixed bug where quantum slimes would intentionally escape directly to the Slime Sea. It is unclear if one day they would return as hardened, salt-crusted pirates, but we just weren't going to take that chance.
    Fixed bug where pink quantum largos would eat quantum plorts but not boom plorts.
    Fixed bug where quantum crystal largo would appear pink while rolling.
    Fixed bug where quantum largos were not transparent went[sic] held on the vac.
    Fixed bug where water was not going in through corral walls.
    Fixed bug where fashion pods were not going in through corral walls.
    Fixed bug where echoes were showing as 'Echoes' when targeted instead of the specified type (e.g. 'Red Echo')
