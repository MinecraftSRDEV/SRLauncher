The 1.4.1 update helps prepare Slime Rancher for Wiggly Wonderland! It is currently available on PC and will be coming to console later this week.

We're very excited for Wiggly Wonderland to begin and we can't wait to see all of your decorated ranches and musical creations!

There will be plenty of fun surprises happening both on the Far, Far Range and outside of the game. Make sure you're following Monomi Park and Slime Rancher on your favorite media spots so you don't miss a thing ;
