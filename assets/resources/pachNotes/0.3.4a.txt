Changes:

    The Ranch house now has a new background image that changes based on the time of day.
    The Ranch house's door now has an open/close sound effect, because silent doors are spooky.
    Puddle slimes now blush when they become too shy to make plorts. If you're trying to picture this, your mental picture is likely not adorable enough.

Bugfixes:

    Fixed an issue where phosphor slimes could sometimes disappear from the Grotto or corrals with solar shields.
    Fixed an issue where tabbies would fight over a chicken instead of the fastest one simply eating it like nature intended.
    Fixed an issue where a slime stack would result in slime folding into themselves.
    Fixed an issue where rad largos would become invisible when held.
    Fixed an issue where the tutorial would become stuck.
