    Added Slime Toy dispenser in Mochi's Manor since some of you would rather be entertaining slimes instead of working.
    Did some minor landscaping in Mochi’s garden.
    Fixed bug where some gadgets placed in Mochi's Manor were disappearing if you weren’t looking. It’s safe to blink and/or quit playing Slime Rancher now.
    Fixed bug where certain gold gordos (not pointing any fingers here) in Rush Mode could “forget” how many gingers they'd eaten after you left the game.
    Fixed bug where a Rush Mode feature snuck into Adventure Mode. The plort market is back to showing market trends and no longer show stars for plorts you’ve sold a lot of.
