A small bugfix patch has arrived today. It includes the following changes:

Bugfixes:

    Fix bug resetting custom control settings.
    Fix bug where some slimes were invisible underwater.
    Fix bug where time could be put in fast-forward mode using the Emergency Return function.

Changes:

    Increased the potency of Scareslimes. The Scareslimes felt bad that slimes would sometimes just ignore them entirely and we're making this change in order to boost their self-esteem.
