Changes:

    Resources can now be vac'd out of autofeeders for those indecisive ranchers.
    The game name for new games now supports any character (including spaces and special characters) and can be up to 24 characters long. (Note: The filename used to store the save now takes the form of {timestamp}_{gamenamelettersandnumbers} )
    Changed the way the load game screen is populated. It should be slightly faster now when you have a very large number of saves, provided they are saved with the newest format.

Fixes:

    Fixed bug where clicking back/cancel from emergency return warning popup did not allow you to navigate the pause menu with a controller.
    Fixed bug where med station could sometimes overfill the health bar.
    Fixed bug where the Invalid Format warning in the Load Game menu would show text exiting the boundaries of the Load Game window and the buttons would be sized inappropriately.
    Fixed missing level geometry on ledge near honey gordo.
    Fixed missing level geometry causing a gap in Moss Blanket.
    Fixed bug sometimes allowing you to interact with the scene after starting emergency return and causing strange time loops (technical term).
