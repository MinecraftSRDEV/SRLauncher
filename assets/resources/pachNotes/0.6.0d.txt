A small patch was issued today to address some additional issues related to the Glass Desert Update release:

    Fixed an XBox-specific bug where buttons around scrolling areas on the main menu could sometimes appear garbled.
    Fixed bug where some slime toys' effect area was smaller than intended.
    Fixed bug where the Quantum Mosaic Largo's mosaic shell was sometimes entirely hidden within its body.
    Fixed bug where sound would sometimes cut out after too much time around Dervish Slimes.
    Fixed bug where returning to Largos in a corral with an auto-feeder and plort-collector would sometimes not produce all of the proper plorts.
    Fixed bug where Diversification achievement was not properly counting Largos across all parts of the Ranch.
    Fixed bug where carrots and parsnips would sometimes become stuck against corral posts.
    Optimized some textures for a minor memory usage improvement.
    Optimized some object management for a minor CPU usage improvement.
