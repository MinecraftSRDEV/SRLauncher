A small patch was issued today to address a few issues related to the Slime Science Update:

    Fixed some missing sounds that include the feral largo spawn, and the boom slime's explosion. Because boom slimes really did not need to be silent AND deadly.
    Fixed some issues with geometry pop-in.
    Fixed an issue with Slime Sea becoming invisible in certain narrow situations. We realize this is just more fuel for those Slime Sea deniers out there.
    Fixed already-open treasure pods replaying their effects on reloading a game, because the party must eventually end.
